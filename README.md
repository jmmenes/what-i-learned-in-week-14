## Pagination

The pagination design pattern is widely used in websites that open up a lot of content to users. From search engines such as Google and Firefox, to e-commerce sites such as Amazon and Asos—the use of pagination is very, very broad.

Pagination is the process of splitting the contents of a website, or a section of contents from a website, into discrete pages. This user interface design pattern is what we designers use to save site visitors from being overwhelmed by a mass of data on one page

Pagination in web applications is usually controlled by a code, which typically orders dataset items from newest to oldest. It is prevalent in web design, appearing in most web applications to allow direct access to divided contents across a number of different pages. When dealing with very large numbers of items, these codes see that page breaks are automatically set with the use of rules and algorithms, which are based on cultural and semantic factors. These factors determine which page of contents each item belongs to in the pagination number list (i.e., whether they are related, in which case they should be on the same page, or a different page if they are not connected). Algorithms and rules are also employed when dividing contents in search engines, where items are arranged on the basis of a number of different factors, such as the regularity with which the search term appears within websites and electronic documents.

Pagination patterns are usually placed at the bottom of all the pages—containing the individual items—within the dataset.
